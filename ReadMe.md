# Embedded Command FIFO
This repo contains a FIFO that works pretty nicely to hold commands on an embedded system. cmd_fifo.c & cmd_fifo.h should seemlessly port into an embedded project. cmd_fifo_test.c is a unit test/excerciser to test the general functionality of the FIFO as well as corner cases.
